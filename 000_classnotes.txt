Introduction to Programming
What is Programming?
What is Language?
what is Programming Language?

two types of companies:
1. product - C,CPP & DSA *****
2. service - tech stack

Why C?
1. The OS X kernel is written mostly in C. 
    Every program and driver in a Mac runs on a C-powered kernel. 

2. Microsoft Windows is primarily written in C and C++

3. The Python interpreter, called CPython, is written in the C programming language. Python borrows some syntax from C, but it uses whitespace to organize code, which makes it easier to read. 

4. "Most of the Software in Tesla cars is C or C++"

5. "No programming language has come close to C or C++ when it comes to efficiency.

6. If you want to work for companies dealing with hardware such as NASA, SpaceX, Intel, Tesla or Nvidia, forget about the Javascript framework, and aim for C!

-----------------
Structure of a C Program

Comment Lines
Single Line - // This is a comment

Multiple -
/*
this
is 
a 
comment */

# include <stdio.h>

# - pre processor directive

<global declaration>

main() //entry point/engine
{
  <local declaration>
  //code
  <variable declarations>
  <statements>

}

//user defined functions
f1()
{
}

f2()
{
}

There are 29/31 header files(contains functions)
There are 32 keywords
int,char,float,double,if,else,do,while,for etc....

Algorithm - the step by step process to solve a problem.
Algorithms are expressed in two ways:

1. Pseudocodes 
2. Flowcharts


Datatype

a=10
b=20
c=a+b
print c - 30

a="raj"
b="jain"
c=a+b
print c - raj jain


int a=10
there 4 basic datatypes

char - 1 byte - %c (format specifier)
int - 4 bytes - %d
float - 4 bytes - %f
double - 8 bytes - %lf

-----------------
Day 4:
Date: 7th Jan 2025
-----------------
printf() - output function

ex:
printf("Hi Welcome");

scanf() - input function
int age;
scanf("%d",&age);


Compiler - Special Software which translates the source code into machine code
Editor 

IDE - Integreated Development Enviormnment

-----------------
Day 5:

Compile - .o
Make - .exe
Build = Compile + Make
